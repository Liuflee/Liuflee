# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Anette, a passionate computer science student on a journey to pursue my dreams. Here you'll find a collection of my personal projects, primarily focused on Python.

## About Me

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, immersing myself in the exciting world of software development and computer engineering. As a problem solver at heart, I thrive on algorithmic thinking and love to build innovative solutions. My goal is to leverage the power of technology to create meaningful and impactful projects.

I'm particularly fascinated by the intersection of data science and software engineering. Exploring data, extracting insights, and applying them to develop intelligent applications is where my passion truly lies.
